# Theme Variants

SilkCircuit offers five distinct variants, each crafted for different environments and preferences.

## At a Glance

| Variant | Background | Intensity | Best For |
|---------|-----------|-----------|----------|
| **Neon** | `#12101a` | 100% | Maximum vibrancy, dark rooms |
| **Vibrant** | `#0f0c1a` | 85% | Balanced energy, everyday use |
| **Soft** | `#1a1626` | 70% | Extended coding sessions |
| **Glow** | `#0a0816` | 100%+ | Ultra-dark, low-light environments |
| **Dawn** | `#faf8ff` | Light | Daytime, bright rooms |

## Switching Variants

### Via Configuration

```lua
require("silkcircuit").setup({
  variant = "dawn",  -- "neon", "vibrant", "soft", "glow", "dawn"
})
```

### At Runtime

```vim
:SilkCircuit neon
:SilkCircuit vibrant
:SilkCircuit soft
:SilkCircuit glow
:SilkCircuit dawn
```

Your preference is automatically saved and persisted across sessions.

## Dark Variants

All dark variants share the same semantic color mappings—only the intensity and backgrounds differ:

- **[Neon](/variants/neon)** — Pure, saturated colors at maximum intensity
- **[Vibrant](/variants/vibrant)** — Slightly reduced saturation, easier on the eyes
- **[Soft](/variants/soft)** — Gentler colors for marathon coding sessions
- **[Glow](/variants/glow)** — Ultra-dark backgrounds with pure neon for maximum contrast

## Light Variant

**[Dawn](/variants/dawn)** is a complete light theme with inverted colors optimized for bright environments:

- Light purple-tinted backgrounds
- Deep, saturated accent colors for contrast
- Same semantic meanings (purple = keywords, cyan = functions)

## Choosing Your Variant

::: tip When to Use Each

**Neon** — Maximum visual impact in dark rooms

**Vibrant** — Everyday use with balanced energy and comfort

**Soft** — Long coding sessions, especially late at night

**Glow** — Very dark environments or high-contrast monitors

**Dawn** — Daytime, well-lit rooms, or outdoor coding

## Consistency Across Variants

All variants maintain:

- **Semantic consistency** — Keywords are always purple, functions are always cyan
- **WCAG AA compliance** — 4.5:1 minimum contrast ratios
- **Plugin compatibility** — Full support for 40+ integrations
- **Terminal integration** — Matching ANSI colors
