# Theme Variants

## Overview

| Variant | Background | Intensity | Best For |
|---------|-----------|-----------|----------|
| **Neon** | `#12101a` | 100% | Maximum vibrancy |
| **Vibrant** | `#0f0c1a` | 85% | Balanced energy |
| **Soft** | `#1a1626` | 70% | Extended sessions |
| **Glow** | `#0a0816` | 100%+ | Low-light environments |

## Switching Variants

### Via Configuration

```lua
require("silkcircuit").setup({
  variant = "dawn",  -- or "neon", "vibrant", "soft", "glow"
})
```

Your preference is automatically saved for future sessions.

## Variant Comparison

### Dark Variants

All dark variants share the same semantic color mappings—only the intensity and backgrounds differ:

- **Neon** — Pure, saturated colors at maximum intensity
- **Vibrant** — Slightly reduced saturation, easier on the eyes
- **Soft** — Gentler colors for marathon coding sessions
- **Glow** — Ultra-dark backgrounds with pure neon colors for maximum contrast

### Light Variant

**Dawn** is a complete light theme with inverted colors optimized for bright environments:

- Light purple-tinted backgrounds
- Deep, saturated accent colors for contrast
- Same semantic color meanings (purple = keywords, cyan = functions)

## Choosing Your Variant

::: tip When to Use Each Variant

**Neon** — When you want maximum visual impact and are working in a dark room.

**Vibrant** — For everyday use with a good balance of energy and comfort.

**Soft** — For long coding sessions, especially late at night.

**Glow** — In very dark environments or when using high-contrast monitors.

**Dawn** — During daytime, in well-lit rooms, or when working outdoors.
