# Introduction

SilkCircuit is a unified color system for your entire development environment. One palette, consistent semantics, WCAG AA compliant:from Neovim to VS Code to your terminal to your browser.

## Why SilkCircuit?

### Electric Meets Elegant

SilkCircuit themes 20+ tools with the same palette and semantic mappings. Keywords are always purple, functions are always cyan, strings are always pink:whether you're in Neovim, VS Code, or reading a diff in your terminal.
